[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a simple Java 25 console app repo that exemplifies how to work with the most important Java core APIs.

[**Content**]<br>
This project tackles some of the main Java 25 APIs, including, but not limited to:
- Optional
- DateTime
- Reflection
- Annotation
- RegEx
- Cryptography
- Stream
- Exception
- Logger
- Collection
- Input/Output (IO, NIO, NIO2)

You can clone this project locally with you Git or import the repository directly to your IDE. The IDE used to create this project was IntelliJ Ultimate, but it should run on any IDE. If your IDE demands the creation of a module to run this project, as IntelliJ, you can simply do it by accessing the modules section, at the Projects Structure Setting of the IDE, and asking it to create the module, setting your local JDK or JRE at it. As modules involve individual custom configurations of your local environment, the .iml files shouldn't be pushed to the remote Git repository (or GitHub). Each person should create his own project modules. Also, as this is a project aimed at beginners, we've not used Maven nor Containerized the application. It's just simple Java classes, to be compiled and run by your Java 25 local installation.
