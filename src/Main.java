/*
This is the main class (entrypoint) of this project.
It's meant to execute sample code implementations, using each discussed Java core API (the most used APIs of Java).
The API examples are organized into their own packages, for instance, com.danielpm1982.optional, com.danielpm1982.datetime,
and so on.
Detailed explanation is available at the code itself, at each class, at each package.
This project was implemented using Java OpenJDK 25. If your IDE asks for the Java module (.iml), when trying to run this
project, you can simply create it - at the IDE respective section - and point out to your installation package of Java 25.
No further dependencies are necessary. For the greatest simplicity, we didn't use Maven here.
